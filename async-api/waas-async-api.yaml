        description: |
          WaaS partners receive notifications upon any attempt to make a card operation. 
          These notifications are supposed to inform the customer on the operation status and the remaining balance, or they can state the reason for denial. 
          These notifications have to be sent by the partner. 
          The partner may choose an appropriate way to convey this information, be it an SMS or a push notification. 
          Our service provides the parameters of the message, but not the message itself, so the partners may create their own customized templates.
          
          A partner may structure the messages according to the following templates:
          
          |Notification type|Conditions for the notification|Notification structure|
